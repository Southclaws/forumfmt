Maintaining documentation is already difficult, maintaining it on two different
platforms in two different formats is just annoying.

## Overview

This tool means you can simply have a single markdown readme file in your
project's repo and when you post it to the forums or update the topic, all you
need to do is simply run this tool over the markdown text to generate BBCode.

For example, this:

```markdown
The Swiss Army Knife of SA:MP - vital tools for any server owner or library
maintainer.

## Overview

Server management and configuration tools:

* Manage your server settings in JSON format (compiles to server.cfg)
* Run the server from `sampctl` and let it worry about automatic restarts
* Automatically download Windows/Linux server binaries when you need them
```

becomes this:

```json
The Swiss Army Knife of SA:MP - vital tools for any server owner or library maintainer.

[*]Manage your server settings in JSON format (compiles to server.cfg)

[*]Run the server from [FONT="courier new"]sampctl[/FONT] and let it worry about automatic restarts

[*]Automatically download Windows/Linux server binaries when you need them

[/LIST]
```

And, as you can probably guess by now, this topic was generated using the tool!

## Installation

The app is a simple Go app so just `go get` it:

```bash
go get github.com/Southclaws/forumfmt
```

If you don't have Go installed, there are precompiled binaries available
[on the releases page](https://github.com/Southclaws/forumfmt/releases).

## Usage

Then you can use the command, either by passing input and output files as an
argument:

```bash
forumfmt README.md README.bbcode
```

Or by piping to stdin and/or stdout on Unix platforms:

```bash
cat README.md | forumfmt > README.bbcode
```

You can also specify a style file to use, to determine the forum look, but only
when all parameters are given:

```bash
forumfmt README.md README.bbcode southclaws
```

The available styles are:

* `southclaws`
* `yless`

Feel free to PR more styles if you want, just copy the existing `.json` files.
