```pawn
// this is a nice piece of code
//don't you agree?
if (houseid != INVALID_HOUSE_ID) { // if the player is inside a house, get the exterior location of the house
else if (!GetPlayerPos(playerid, x, y, z)) { //the player isn't connected, presuming that GetPlayerHouseID returns INVALID_HOUSE_ID in that case 
else if {//some other case
else {// otherwise
